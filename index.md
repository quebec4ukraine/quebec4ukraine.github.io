Resourceful French-Canadian volunteering in Ukraine and giving much needed care and attention to refugees and victims of war crimes.


I am also training in the Georgian Legion with associates in order to be fully ready to 'welcome' the Russian invaders when they show up in our neighborhood.


Lastly, I am available for specific jobs if required. Example of what I've done and what I can do:
- Delivery of military hardware and weapons on the frontlines
- Setting up a computer system / network
- Teaching how to use encryption
- Wiring electricity in a bomb shelter / basement.
